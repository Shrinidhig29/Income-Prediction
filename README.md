**The Problem Statement**

It is the classification problem where we need to predict Customer default credit card payment or not!

**Data Description**

There are 25 variables:

    - ID: ID of each client
    -  LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit
    -  SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
    -  EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
    -  MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
    -  AGE: Age in years
    -  PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 
    2=payment delay for two months, ‚Ä¶ 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
    -  PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
    -  PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
    -  PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
    -  PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
    - PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
    -  BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -   BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
    -  default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)

**Application Architecture and Module vision**

**Code Explaination**
     
- **Data Ingestion**
- **Data Preprocessing and cleaning**
     
    Data Validation 
    In this step, we perform different sets of validation on the given set of training files.  
    - **Name Validation**- We validate the name of the files based on the given name in the schema file. We have created a regex pattern as per the name given in the schema file to use for validation. After validating the pattern in the name, we check for the length of date in the file name as well as the length of time in the file name. If all the values are as per requirement, we move such files to "Good_Data_Folder" else we move such files to "Bad_Data_Folder."

    - **Number of Columns** - We validate the number of columns present in the files, and if it doesn't match with the value given in the schema file, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder."


    - **Name of Columns** - The name of the columns is validated and should be the same as given in the schema file. If not, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".

    - **The datatype of columns** - The datatype of columns is given in the schema file. This is validated when we insert the files into Database. If the datatype is wrong, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".


    * **Null values in columns** - If any of the columns in a file have all the values as NULL or missing, we discard such a file and move it to "Bad_Data_Folder".



- **Model Selection**

    Model Training 
    - **Data Export from Db** - The data in a stored database is exported as a CSV file to be used for model training.
    - **Data Preprocessing**   
        - a) Drop columns not useful for training the model. Such columns were selected while doing the EDA.
        - b) Replace the invalid values with numpy ‚Äúnan‚Äù so we can use imputer on such values.
        - d) Check for null values in the columns. If present, impute the null values using the KNN imputer
        - e) Scale the training and test data separately 
    - **Clustering** - KMeans algorithm is used to create clusters in the preprocessed data. The optimum number of clusters is selected by plotting the elbow plot, and for the dynamic selection of the number of clusters, we are using "KneeLocator" function. The idea behind clustering is to implement different algorithms
    To train data in different clusters. The Kmeans model is trained over preprocessed data and the model is saved for further use in prediction.
    - **Model Selection** - After clusters are created, we find the best model for each cluster. We are using two algorithms, "Decision Tree Regressor" and "XGBoost regressor". For each cluster, both the algorithms are passed with the best parameters derived from GridSearch. We calculate the Rsquared scores for both models and select the model with the best score. Similarly, the model is selected for each cluster. All the models for every cluster are saved for use in prediction. 

- **Model Tunning**
- **Prediction**
    - Based on the cluster number, the respective model is loaded and is used to predict the data for that cluster.
- **Logging Framework**
- **Deployment**

**requirements.txt** file consists of all the packages that you need to deploy the app in the cloud.
